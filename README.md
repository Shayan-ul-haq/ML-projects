End-to-End Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end machine learning projects designed with a results-first and problem-driven approach. Each project begins with a clearly defined business or research problem and follows a standardized, reproducible machine learning pipeline to ensure clarity, consistency, and measurable outcomes.

The workflow includes:

Data collection and validation from structured and unstructured sources

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, relationships, and potential biases

Feature engineering and preprocessing, including scaling, encoding, dimensionality reduction, and data cleaning

Model training and hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation and systematic optimization techniques

Evaluation, benchmarking, and comparison of results using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision-recall, ROC-AUC, RMSE, and silhouette score

The projects cover both supervised and unsupervised learning, addressing tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. A wide range of models is implemented and compared, including Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost-style approaches), and Neural Networks.

The repository also includes computer vision–based machine learning workflows, where OpenCV is used for:

Image preprocessing and augmentation

Feature extraction and transformation

Integrating visual data into traditional ML and neural network pipelines

All solutions are implemented using industry-standard frameworks such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, with an emphasis on clean code, reproducibility, interpretability, and performance evaluation. The structure of the repository allows interviewers and reviewers to quickly navigate from problem definition to final results, making it suitable as a professional ML portfolio for data science and machine learning engineering roles.
